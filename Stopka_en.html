      <h1 style="color:Blue;">Why 'GW-Basic' and 'C'?</h1>

      <h2 style="color:Green;">Developing vs Programming</h2>
      <p>The programming process can be considered as a creating codes in a wide range of them use (in practice unlimited in subjects) with the possibility of a diverse path leading to similar results - this depends on the programmer, the possibility of expanding the functionality of the code in specific directions, usually predicted in advance, the amount of resources consumed (memory, implementation of external procedures), the time-consuming process, etc.<br/></p>
      <hr>
      <p>On the other hand, there is a process of building a result with a help of built-in (or 'imported'), ready to use modules, 'components' for a strictly specified purpose. An example would be the 'Django': step1, step2,..., stepN and the result of a website is ready. Where is the classic of the programming? It is true that many images and routine texts are added here, but they can be treated as one changing itself element, just like in the 'for' loop. One 'for' loop does not make the code programming... This process could be called rather an 'operating' than a 'programming'.  One of the advantages of Python is the 'batteries included' philosophy in the form of the ability to import over 120,000 packages, usually with many functions in each of them.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Today IT employee is someone between a 'programmer' and an 'operator'. Such a person is called a 'developer'. That is why, the companies recruit for the positions: Java Developer, Python Developer (due to the ready-to-use functionality of modules), COBOL Developer (due to the extremely limited use of this language) and other 'developers'. With a lot of exaggeration, I can ironically say that a Harry Potter's fan could be a good IT employee - he/she just needs to know the spells (I mean: knowing built-in or imported functions and their syntax).</p>
      <p>So programming or operation...?</p>
      <hr>
      <p><b>However, 'C programmers' are still in demand, as 'GW-Basic programmers' long time ago.</b></p>
      <p><b>Free emulators: Borland TurboC++ version 3.0 from 1991 and GW-Basic from 1988 work flawlessly on the latest computers.</b></p>
      <p><b>Microsoft's 'Dev C++' version without graphics is freely available, but currently, there is no one free graphics package for any PC.  'libbgi.a' on a 32-bit computer will not run on a 64-bit computer.</b></p>
      <br><br>


      <h2 style="color:Green;">The times (they) are changing</h2>

      <h3 style="color:BlueViolet;">1. Programming activity outside the workplace.</h3>
      <p>In the past, when the public Internet was just emerging, I sometimes sent my single thematically codes (just like on this website) to companies together with my CV*. However, this was totally ignored by these companies.
      <br>Nowadays, many recruitment companies ask the candidates for codes in their 'GitHub' or a private website.</p>

      <h3 style="color:BlueViolet;">2. Costs of using built-in functions.</h3>

      <h3 style="color:Peru;"><b>a) More or less necessary modules.</b></h3>
      <p>Each programming language consists of so-called 'primitives' (the simplest elements available in a programming language, like axioms in mathematics) based on which are built such popular (everywhere, from COBOL to Python**) functions like 'reverse', 'UpperCase' and 'LoverCase' - so simple to define and so rare used that we can be surprised to see them.</p>

      <h3 style="color:Peru;"><b>b) Memory costs.</b></h3>
      <p>I have created a simple HTML page and checked the 'properties' of this folder (approximate values):<br>- Size: 140 KB<br>- Contains: 20 Files, 9 Folders</p>
      <p>I have built a similar website by importing React (import React from "react";). A minute before, I had to run 'npx create-react-app' on my folder. 'Properties' of the folder:<br>- Size: 224 MB<br>- Contains: 36 814 Files, 4 866 Folders<br><b>Shock!</b></p>

      <h3 style="color:Peru;"><b>c) Lack of possibilities to change and expand the built-in functions</b></h3>
      <p>We can changed/expanded our own code in any direction.</p>
      <p>If you want to change the built-in functions, first be familiar with - as above - the code of almost 37000 files in 5000 folders. Good luck!</p>

      <h3><b>The efficiency of the process is difficult to control here - it is not even taken care of.</b></h3>
      <br><hr>

      <p>* So my codes presented here may have been available to an unspecified number of people for many years.</p>
      <p>** Among them are languages that are not very popular today (Prolog, R, Pascal, etc), one-season applications (e.g. PowerBuilder) as well as the almost forgotten FORTRAN and Algol of the mainframe environment, without which today's IT would not exist, because everything that was done before was usually copied to what was done later. E.g. operations on strings: REXX --> ... --> R --> Python.</p>
      <br><br>


      <h2 style="color:Green;">Versatility is an enemy of schemes</h2>

      <p><b>Programming</b> should be conducive to <b>modelling</b> because it supports science for technology purposes. So far, the last one is developing along the least resistance line, often supporting ethically questionable sectors. Science is advancing too slowly to prevent this chaos.</p>
      <p><b>Modelling</b> (implementing interactive elements) is our best way to find a relationship with the laws of Nature.</p>
      <p><b>Programming</b> is a natural way to support modelling what we are aware of, what we are experiencing, but we are not able to understand it. So to approach a real situation we are creating models that are getting closer and closer to what we notice. This requires non-routine behavior. That is why scientists often grasp at any theories in the hope that their work may be useful one day.</p>
